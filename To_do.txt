Stage of programming:
Project inspired by Stoet et al article: Are women better than men at multitasking

Coding gender:
Need to ask the participants to input their gender

Coding frame: 
Yellow frame, two part: one up with the word "Shape", one down with the word "Filling"

Stimuli:
Rectangle and diamond, empty figures, yellow. Fill with 2 or 3 small solid circles, black.
4 types of stimuli in total.

Randomisation:
The stimuli has to always appear in an incongruent setting: if the top requires a left-hand response (e), the bottom requires a right-hand response (n), and same for the opposite.
The randomisation is between settings:
Rectangle + three circle
Diamond + Two circle 
8 designs possible

Task:
Two control key to compute, need to have the two for a task to end: shape (with e and i key) or filling (with c and n key)

Analysis: 
Need column with id and gender. Need the key pressed and the order of them. Need the reaction time.
