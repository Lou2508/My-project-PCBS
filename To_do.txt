Stage of programming:
Project inspired by Stoet et al article: Are women better than men at multitasking

Coding gender:
Need to ask the participants to input their gender

Coding frame: 
Yellow frame, two part: one up with the word "Shape", one down with the word "Filling"

Stimuli:
Rectangle and diamond, empty figures, yellow. Fill with 2 or 3 small solid circles, black.
4 types of stimuli in total.

Block design:
The stimuli can be congruent (shape and filling would require the same key) on incongruent (require different key).
Half of the trials need to be incongruent one.

Feedback:
Two possibilities: "Time is up" is the 4 seconds are finished, or "That was the wrong key" for false answers.

Task:
Two control key to compute, need to have the two for a task to end: shape (with e and i key) or filling (with c and n key)
If the response is incorrect (time or key): 5s reminder of the stimulus_response mapping, then 500ms pause.
The intertrial interval lasts 800ms.

Analysis: 
Need column with id and gender. Need the key pressed and the order of them. Need the reaction time.
