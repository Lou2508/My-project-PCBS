Project inspired by Stoet et al article: Are women better than men at multitasking

This program aims at testing the stereotypical assumption that women are better than men in multitasking. 
The two tasks here are computing the shape of a figure (rectangle or diamond) and the filling of them (one or two circles).
The two tasks are always presented in a way that opposite responses were required (left and right).
Feedbacks are provided after each trial.
